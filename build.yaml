# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#

# board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
# shield: [ "mykeyball_left", "mykeyball_right" ]
# include:
#  - board: nice_nano_v2
#    shield: mykeyball_left
# - board: nice_nano_v2
#  shield: mykeyball_right
    
board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
shield: [ "example_left", "example_right" ]
